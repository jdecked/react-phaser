# react-phaser

These are React bindings for Phaser 3. Unfortunately, before this there was the [react-phaser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-phaser) that supported Phaser 2, but it doesn't look like it'll be updated for Phaser 3.

I built this for a class at school. It doesn't support plugins yet because I didn't need them. I probably won't add them until someone needs them. With that in mind, this should be OK and I'll maintain it at much as I can, but use at your own peril.
